A dynamical simulation of the RARL Hexapod platform using the [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) physics engine.
This is a forked project that has been altered and added to, in order work with a central pattern generator (CPG) controller.
It was done for my honours project. 

**Please read the research paper for more details**
